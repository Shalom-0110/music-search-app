Music Search App! ðŸŽµ

This is a simple Flask web application that allows you to search for music using the iTunes API. Enter a search term, and you'll get a list of music albums that match your query.

Features:
Search for song
View Results: See album names, artists, and album names in the results.

Currently, the app shows a list of albums and their details, but I plan to add a feature that lets you play song previews directly from the search results. 
I will update it soon!
